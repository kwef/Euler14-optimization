Euler14-optimization
====================

Progressively optimized versions (in Haskell) of a solution to Problem 14 from Project Euler (<http://projecteuler.net/problem=14>).

The source files are formatted such that one can flip quickly back and forth between them to see changes, as similar code is visually aligned between files.

Every version takes as its first argument the size of problem to solve, with a default of 1,000,000. This may be specified in floating-point notation, like `Version1 1e6`.

Summary of Versions
-------------------

* `Common` contains code common to some or all versions. It imports every other module used by the various versions, and re-exports them. It also defines:
   + the recurrence relation for the Collatz sequence
   + IO accessors to get positional command line arguments
* `MutableArray` contains safe array manipulation functions used by array-based implementations (versions 4-6)
* `Version1` is a na√Øve, declarative implementation based upon the problem definition. It generates every sequence up to the maximum starting number, and finds the maximum-length sequence. Time to solve: 8.76 s.
* `Version2` eliminates the generation of a list for each sequence, instead defining a `collatzLength` function which finds the length of a sequence directly. Time to solve: 3.60 s.
* `Version3` introduces purely functional memoization, in the form of a key-value map encapsulated in a state monad. Time to solve: 1.58 s.
* `Version4` trades out the purely functional state monad for the `ST` monad, using a mutable array for memoization. Time to solve: 0.52 s.
* `Version5` eliminates the separate, list-based, maximum-finding step, by using mutable `STRef`s to keep track of the maximum. Time to solve: 0.19 s.
* `Version6` migrates to the `IO` monad for coordinated parallel computation with global memoization. The `STM` monad prevents thread-synchronization issues in updating the maximum value and in assigning chunks of work to threads. A `Config` datatype is introduced to make passing configuration data less verbose. Time to solve: 0.05 s.
   + Version 6 takes additional command line arguments after the problem size, in this order: chunk size, cache size, number of cores. An underscore (`_`) denotes that the program should substitute the default for that argument.

Compilation Notes
-----------------

For the results I list, all versions were compiled with `-O2` optimizations turned on.

Version 4 needs extra stack space and should be compiled with `-rtsopts -with-rtsopts -K50M` (for default problem size), and possibly with larger sizes than `50M` in case of larger problem sizes (the stack space may also be specified at run-time by appending `+RTS -K<size>` in the shell).

Version 6 is multithreaded and must be compiled as such. Use: `-threaded -rtsopts -with-rtsopts -N8`. For best performance on modern processors with hyperthreading, substitute for `8` the number of cores on your machine multiplied by two.
